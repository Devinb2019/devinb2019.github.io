# Devin Burdick - Capstone ePortfolio

## Professional Self-Assessment
Completing the Computer Science program and building this ePortfolio has been both the highlight and the final step of my academic journey. It has given me a way to showcase the technical skills, problem-solving ability, and professional readiness I’ve developed over time, while also tying everything back to my career goals in the field of computer science.

### Showcasing Strengths and Shaping Professional Goals
Putting this portfolio together gave me the chance to reflect on the range of experiences I’ve had throughout the program. Each project highlights a core strength—whether it’s writing clean, modular code; improving algorithms for speed and efficiency; integrating reliable database solutions; or designing software with security in mind from the start. These strengths, paired with my ability to clearly document and explain my work, have reinforced my goal of becoming a software engineer who delivers scalable, efficient, and secure solutions.

### Collaboration and Communication
Over the course of my studies, I’ve learned the value of strong teamwork and clear communication. Group assignments and peer code reviews taught me how to work effectively with others, use version control to stay organized, and write code that’s easy for teammates to understand. I’ve also gained experience explaining technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences, making sure that solutions align with both the business needs and the technical requirements.

### Technical Competencies
**Data Structures and Algorithms:** I’ve worked with a variety of data structures—like `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`—and applied sorting algorithms to boost performance. I’ve developed a solid grasp of complexity analysis, ensuring that my solutions balance efficiency and maintainability.

**Software Engineering and Databases:** I’ve refactored codebases into modular components for better maintainability and scalability. I also integrated SQLite into projects, moving from basic file storage to a fully relational database setup with strong data integrity. These experiences have built my confidence in creating full-stack solutions that manage data securely and reliably.

**Security:** I’ve made it a habit to consider security from the very beginning of any project. This has included using defensive programming practices, validating user inputs, and ensuring database operations protect data integrity. Anticipating risks and reducing vulnerabilities has become a natural part of my workflow.

### Integrating the Portfolio Artifacts
The three enhancements in this portfolio tell a story of growth and versatility. The **Software Design and Engineering** work shows my ability to build maintainable, scalable systems. The **Algorithms and Data Structures** work highlights my focus on performance and feature improvements through the right data structure choices. The **Database** work demonstrates my ability to integrate professional-level data management with security in mind.

Together, they show that I’m ready for the challenges of real-world software development—combining technical expertise with the ability to work well in a team. This portfolio is more than a collection of past work; it’s proof that I’m prepared to make meaningful contributions in the field.
